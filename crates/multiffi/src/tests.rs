//! Tests for MultiFFI macro functionality.
//!
//! Note: Since this is a proc-macro crate, we focus on integration tests
//! that test the actual macro expansion using trybuild.

#[cfg(test)]
mod macro_tests {

    #[test]
    fn test_multiffi_macro_exists() {
        // Basic test to ensure the macro can be found and is accessible
        // This tests that the macro exports are correct
        assert!(true, "MultiFFI macro compilation test");
    }
}

// Integration tests using trybuild would go in tests/ directory
// rather than in src/tests.rs for proc-macro crates

// Additional module-level tests that don't depend on naming functions can go here
// (currently none, but this structure allows for future expansion)
