## Rationale for Bootstrap-First

1. **AI Changes Everything**: Build/market/support at 1/10th traditional cost
2. **Developer Tools = Fast Revenue**: Developers buy quickly if value is clear
3. **Perfect Situation**: Low burn (Bangladesh) + Mark's support = infinite runway
4. **Control = Wealth**: 95% of $1B > 10% of $10B
5. **Optionality**: Can always raise later with traction

---

## Meeting Notes

**Key Discussion Points:**

- Nayeem's preference for maintaining control
- Living situation allows extended runway
- Mark A's consistent support deserves recognition
- AI assistance enables lean operations
- US market clearly dominant for customer base

**Decisions Finalized:**

1. UK Ltd incorporation this week
2. Bootstrap-first approach
3. Mark A gets 2% initial, up to 5% performance-based
4. Delaware migration at revenue milestone
5. Focus on product completion next 4-6 weeks
