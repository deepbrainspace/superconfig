# Plan: Guardy Pre-commit Pivot - Rust Implementation of Pre-commit

## Executive Summary

Strategic pivot recommendation for Guardy: Instead of building "Rust Husky", create a Rust implementation of pre-commit with 100% compatibility with existing pre-commit ecosystem. This positions Guardy to capture significant market share by offering the speed of Rust with the mature ecosystem of pre-commit.

## Conclusion

This pivot represents a significant market opportunity to create the "ruff of git hooks" - a Rust implementation that provides dramatic performance improvements while maintaining full ecosystem compatibility. The combination of Rust's performance advantages and pre-commit's mature ecosystem creates a compelling value proposition for developers and enterprises alike.

The success of tools like ruff (Python linting) and uv (Python packaging) demonstrates the market appetite for Rust-based developer tooling that provides significant performance improvements while maintaining compatibility with existing ecosystems.

## Next Steps

1. **Validate market demand** through developer surveys
2. **Prototype core functionality** to prove technical feasibility
3. **Engage with pre-commit maintainers** for ecosystem alignment
4. **Secure initial funding/resources** for development team
5. **Create detailed technical specifications** for implementation
