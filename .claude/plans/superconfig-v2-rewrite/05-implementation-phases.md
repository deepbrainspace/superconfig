**Total Implementation Time: 34-45 hours** (approximately 4-6 days of focused development)

## Implementation Principles

### Development Approach

- **Incremental**: Each phase builds on solid foundations from previous phases
- **Testable**: Every component includes unit tests before moving to next phase
- **Benchmarked**: Performance validation at each major milestone
- **Documented**: Clear API documentation written alongside implementation

### Quality Gates

- **No Phase Progression**: Until all acceptance criteria are met
- **Performance Validation**: Benchmarks must meet or exceed targets before FFI work
- **Memory Safety**: No unsafe code without thorough justification and testing
- **Error Handling**: Rich error types with source tracking throughout

### Parallel Work Opportunities

- **Documentation**: Can be written alongside implementation
- **Language Bindings**: Python and Node.js bindings can be developed in parallel after Phase 3
- **Advanced Features**: Hot reload and SIMD optimizations can be developed independently after Phase 2

## Phase 1: Core Registry System (4-6 hours)

### Overview

Build the foundational handle-based registry system that enables zero-copy configuration access. This phase establishes the core architecture that all other components depend on.

### Core Components

- **Lock-free Handle Registry**: DashMap-based concurrent registry
- **Type-safe Handle Operations**: Insert, get, update, remove with compile-time safety
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Memory management with reference counting and expiration
- **Thread-safe ID Generation**: Atomic handle ID allocation

### Detailed Tasks

#### 1. Registry Infrastructure (2-3 hours)

```rust
// Core structures to implement
pub struct ConfigRegistry {
    configs: DashMap<HandleId, ConfigEntry>,
    next_id: AtomicU64,
}

pub struct ConfigHandle<T> {
    id: HandleId,
    _phantom: PhantomData<T>,
}
```

**Deliverables:**

- Implement `ConfigRegistry` struct with DashMap backend
- Create `ConfigHandle<T>` with phantom types for type safety
- Add atomic handle ID generation using `AtomicU64`
- Implement basic CRUD operations (insert, get, update, remove)

#### 2. Memory Management (1-2 hours)

**Deliverables:**

- Add reference counting for active handles
- Implement background cleanup task for expired handles
- Create registry statistics (`total_handles`, `memory_usage_bytes`)
- Add handle validation before operations

#### 3. Testing & Validation (1 hour)

**Deliverables:**

- Comprehensive unit tests for all registry operations
- Multi-threaded stress tests (1000+ concurrent operations)
- Memory leak detection tests
- Performance benchmarks (target: <0.5μs lookup time)

### Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ All handle operations are lock-free and thread-safe
- ✅ Memory usage is bounded and predictable (<100KB base overhead)
- ✅ Performance meets sub-microsecond lookup target
- ✅ 100% test coverage for registry operations
- ✅ Zero memory leaks in 24-hour stress test

### Risk Mitigation

- **Handle Lifecycle**: RAII patterns with automatic cleanup
- **Type Safety**: Phantom types prevent runtime type mismatches
- **Memory Leaks**: Comprehensive testing with sanitizers
- **Performance**: Benchmark-driven optimization with continuous monitoring

### Dependencies

- None - this is the foundation phase

### Outputs

- `src/core/registry.rs` - Core registry implementation
- `src/core/handle.rs` - Handle types and operations
- `tests/registry_tests.rs` - Comprehensive test suite
- Performance benchmarks establishing baseline metrics

## Phase 2: Configuration Engine (6-8 hours)

### Overview

Build the core configuration processing engine including file loading, parsing, and merging capabilities.

### Key Deliverables

- Multi-format configuration parsing (JSON, TOML, YAML, ENV)
- Advanced array merging with `_add`/`_remove` patterns
- High-performance file loading with caching
- Environment variable processing with nested key support

### Success Criteria

- ✅ File loading meets 20-30μs performance target
