# SuperConfig V2: Planning Document Index

## Overview

This directory contains the complete blueprint for SuperConfig V2 - a ground-up rewrite designed for extreme performance and multi-language compatibility. Documents are organized in logical phases from high-level architecture to detailed implementation guidance.

## Document Structure

### **Phase 1: Core Architecture (Complete)**

- ✅ **01-architecture-overview.md** - High-level design principles, multi-crate architecture, performance targets
- ✅ **02-missed-features-analysis.md** - Feature completeness analysis comparing V1 and Figment capabilities
- ✅ **03-performance-feasibility-analysis.md** - Performance validation confirming all features achievable with target speeds

### **Phase 2: Implementation Planning (Complete)**

- ✅ **04-crate-structure-and-organization.md** - Multi-crate workspace layout, module organization, and dependency architecture
- ✅ **05-implementation-phases.md** - Detailed development timeline with milestones and dependencies
- ✅ **06-core-engine-design.md** - Handle registry, ConfigData structures, memory layout specifications
- ✅ **07-provider-system-design.md** - File, Environment, Hierarchical, Glob provider implementations
- ✅ **08-ffi-integration-plan.md** - FFI wrapper patterns, binding generation, and language-specific considerations
- ✅ **09-performance-optimization-strategy.md** - SIMD acceleration, caching strategies, memory management details
- ✅ **10-testing-and-benchmarking-plan.md** - Unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks, and CI/CD integration
- ✅ **11-hot-reload-implementation.md** - Comprehensive hot reload system with file watching and atomic updates

### **Phase 3: Development Reference (Pending)**

- 📝 **12-api-design-reference.md** - Complete API specifications for Rust core and all target languages
- 📝 **13-launch-strategy.md** - V2 launch plan, adoption strategies, and ecosystem development
- 📝 **14-deployment-and-packaging.md** - Build system configuration, CI/CD pipelines, distribution strategy

## Document Philosophy

Each document follows these principles:

- **Focused Scope**: Each document covers one specific aspect (~200-500 lines)
- **Actionable Details**: Concrete implementation guidance, not just high-level concepts
- **Performance-First**: Every design decision evaluated against extreme performance targets
- **Multi-Language**: All features considered for FFI compatibility from the start
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns makes updates and tracking progress manageable

## Status Legend

- ✅ **Complete** - Document finished and reviewed
- 📝 **Pending** - Document planned but not yet created
- 🔄 **In Progress** - Document currently being written
- 🔍 **Under Review** - Document complete but needs validation

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Multi-Crate Design

- **superconfig**: Pure Rust core with zero FFI dependencies
- **superconfig-ffi**: Thin wrapper layer using MultiFfi macros
- **multiffi**: Generic procedural macro for multi-language bindings

### Performance Targets

- Configuration Loading: ~20-30μs (vs ~100μs current)
- Handle Lookup: ~0.1-0.5μs (sub-microsecond registry access)
- FFI Overhead: ~0.5-1μs (vs ~100μs current)

### Language Support

- **Python**: Native bindings via PyO3 (snake_case preserved)
- **Node.js**: Native bindings via NAPI-RS (auto camelCase conversion)
- **WebAssembly**: Browser bindings via wasm-bindgen (camelCase)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete Phase 2 implementation planning documents (04-11)
2. Create Phase 3 development reference documents (12-14)
3. Begin implementation following the detailed roadmap
4. Maintain documents as living blueprints throughout development
