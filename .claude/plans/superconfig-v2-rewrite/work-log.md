# SuperConfig V2 Work Log

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Complete ground-up rewrite of SuperConfig V2 using specifications from v2-rewrite plan
- **Version**: v0.2.0
- **Approach**: Incremental development with user approval at each stage
- **Testing Strategy**: Add tests after each implementation phase

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Core Registry System (4-6 hours) - NOT STARTED

**Goal**: Build foundational handle-based registry system for zero-copy configuration access

#### Tasks:

- [ ] Registry Infrastructure (2-3 hours)
  - [ ] Implement `ConfigRegistry` struct with DashMap backend
  - [ ] Create `ConfigHandle<T>` with phantom types for type safety
  - [ ] Add atomic handle ID generation using `AtomicU64`
  - [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations (insert, get, update, remove)

- [ ] Memory Management (1-2 hours)
  - [ ] Add reference counting for active handles
  - [ ] Implement background cleanup task for expired handles
  - [ ] Create registry statistics (`total_handles`, `memory_usage_bytes`)
  - [ ] Add handle validation before operations

- [ ] Testing & Validation (1 hour)
  - [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for all registry operations
  - [ ] Multi-threaded stress tests (1000+ concurrent operations)
  - [ ] Memory leak detection tests
  - [ ] Performance benchmarks (target: <0.5μs lookup time)

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] All handle operations are lock-free and thread-safe
- [ ] Memory usage is bounded and predictable (<100KB base overhead)
- [ ] Performance meets sub-microsecond lookup target
- [ ] 100% test coverage for registry operations
- [ ] Zero memory leaks in 24-hour stress test

### Phase 2: Configuration Engine (6-8 hours) - NOT STARTED

- Multi-format configuration parsing (JSON, TOML, YAML, ENV)
- Advanced array merging with `_add`/`_remove` patterns
- High-performance file loading with caching
- Environment variable processing with nested key support

### Phase 3: API Layers (4-5 hours) - NOT STARTED

- Fluent builder API for configuration construction
- Hierarchical discovery system (system → user → project)
- Profile support for environment-specific configurations
- Type-safe extraction with comprehensive error handling

### Phase 4: FFI Bindings (6-8 hours) - NOT STARTED

- Python bindings via PyO3 with snake_case preservation
- Node.js bindings via NAPI-RS (234x faster than WASM)
- Zero-copy operations where possible
- Language-appropriate error handling and type conversion

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (8-10 hours) - NOT STARTED

- Hot reload system with file watching
- SIMD acceleration for parsing operations
- Performance profiling and metrics collection
- Feature flag organization for optional functionality

### Phase 6: Testing & Polish (6-8 hours) - NOT STARTED

- Complete test suite with >95% coverage
- Performance benchmarks and regression testing
- API documentation with examples
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Progress Notes

### 2025-01-30 - Project Start

- **Status**: Directory structure and dependencies complete
- **Actions**:
  - Reviewed comprehensive v2-rewrite documentation
  - Analyzed existing v1 implementation in crates-archive
  - Created work-log and todo tracking system
  - Set up independent crate structure in `crates/superconfig/`
  - Created Cargo.toml with latest dependency versions (edition 2024)
  - Configured Moon integration for CI/CD
  - Verified crate compiles successfully
- **Next**: Present Phase 1 plan for user approval

### Dependencies Configured

- **Core**: dashmap 7.0.0-rc2, parking_lot 0.12.4, serde 1.0.219
- **Performance**: rayon 1.10.0, simd-json 0.14.3, tokio 1.47.0
- **Parsing**: toml 0.8.19, serde_yml 0.0.12
- **Testing**: criterion 0.5.1, tempfile 3.15.0, serial_test 3.2.0

## Performance Targets

- Configuration loading: ≤30μs (vs current ~100μs)
- Handle operations: ≤0.5μs (sub-microsecond registry access)
- Python FFI: ≤1μs overhead
- Node.js FFI: ≤2μs overhead

## Architecture Overview

- **superconfig**: Pure Rust core with zero FFI dependencies
- **superconfig-py**: Python bindings via PyO3
- **superconfig-napi**: Node.js bindings via NAPI-RS
- Handle-based registry system with DashMap for concurrent access
- Zero-copy design with lightweight handles for efficient lookup
