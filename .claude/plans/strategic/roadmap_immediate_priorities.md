# SuperConfig Immediate Priorities & Roadmap

**Created**: July 27, 2025  
**Author**: Claude Opus 4  
**Status**: Execution Planning
**Objective**: Define next 30-90 day priorities for maximum impact

## 🎯 Priority Matrix (Next 30 Days)

### Priority 1: Claim Your Territory (Week 1)
1. **Publish to crates.io** (TODAY!)
   - Before someone takes the name
   - Even as 0.1.0 "preview"
   - Stakes your claim
   
2. **Keep repo in deepbrainspace org**
   - Shows you're serious (org vs personal)
   - Better for future team additions
   - More professional for enterprise

### Priority 2: Website Launch (Week 1-2)
**Technology Decision: Dioxus/WASM**

Why Dioxus over TypeScript:
- ✅ **Dogfooding**: "Built with SuperConfig + Rust" 
- ✅ **Performance showcase**: Instant loads prove your point
- ✅ **Cloudflare Workers**: Free, global, fast
- ✅ **Consistent stack**: Rust everywhere
- ✅ **Unique differentiator**: How many config tools have WASM websites?

**Website Must-Haves**:
```
superconfig.dev/
├── Hero: "Configuration Management for the Multi-Language Era"
├── Problem: Show config chaos across languages
├── Solution: One library, every language (animated demo)
├── Features:
│   ├── Universal (WASM bindings)
│   ├── Secure (encryption built-in)
│   ├── Fast (Rust benchmarks)
│   └── AI-Ready (MCP preview)
├── Quick Start: 
│   ├── Language selector (Rust/Node/Python/Go)
│   └── Copy-paste examples
├── Comparison: vs dotenv, Vault, etc.
└── CTA: GitHub stars + npm install
```

### Priority 3: Node.js WASM Binding (Week 2-3)
**Why Node first**: 
- Largest ecosystem (npm)
- Easiest adoption path
- Most config pain (dotenv hell)
- Quick feedback loop

**Success Metric**: Working `npm install @superconfig/node` with basic example

### Priority 4: Launch Content (Week 3-4)
1. **Technical Blog Post**: "Why I Built SuperConfig in Rust"
2. **Show HN**: Prepared with demo + benchmarks
3. **Dev.to Article**: "Config Management is Broken. Here's How We Fix It"
4. **Twitter Thread**: Problem → Solution → Demo

## 📊 30-60-90 Day Roadmap

### 30 Days: Foundation
- [x] Core library complete
- [ ] Crates.io published
- [ ] Website live on superconfig.dev
- [ ] Node.js bindings working
- [ ] First 100 GitHub stars
- [ ] Launch posts published

### 60 Days: Adoption
- [ ] Python bindings shipped
- [ ] 1,000 GitHub stars
- [ ] 100+ npm weekly downloads
- [ ] Basic CLI tool
- [ ] Encryption feature (GPG/PGP)
- [ ] First production users

### 90 Days: Growth
- [ ] Go bindings shipped
- [ ] 5,000 GitHub stars
- [ ] GitHub Sponsors active
- [ ] First enterprise inquiry
- [ ] Conference talk submitted
- [ ] Team features planned

## 💰 GitHub Sponsors Strategy

**Yes, set it up** but with this approach:

### Timing: After 1,000 stars
- Shows traction first
- More compelling for sponsors

### Tiers:
```yaml
$5/month - Individual Developer
- ❤️ Supporter badge
- Access to private Discord

$50/month - Startup
- Logo on README (small)
- Priority issue response

$500/month - Enterprise
- Logo on website
- Monthly office hours
- Priority feature requests
```

### Inspiration: 
- Prettier's sponsor wall
- ESLint's approach
- Vue.js tiered benefits

## 🔒 Planning Documents Decision

**Keep them PUBLIC in the repo**. Here's why:

1. **Transparency builds trust**
2. **Shows thoughtful execution**
3. **Attracts contributors** who see the vision
4. **Documentation as marketing**
5. **Nothing truly sensitive** in strategic plans

Just avoid:
- Specific revenue numbers
- Customer names (when you have them)
- Security implementation details

## 🎨 Website Inspiration

Study these for different aspects:

1. **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** - Perfect hero section
2. **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)** - Great multi-language examples
3. **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** - Speed/benchmark focus
4. **[Rome](https://rome.tools)** - Clean, technical aesthetic
5. **[SWC](https://swc.rs)** - Rust tool done right

But make it unique:
- Animated language switcher showing same config
- Live playground (WASM in browser!)
- Security-first messaging
- "Built for AI age" positioning

## 🤖 Claude Plan Recommendation

**Stick with the $100 plan for now**. Here's why:

1. **Sonnet 4 + Opus 4 combo is sufficient**
   - Use Sonnet 4 for routine coding
   - Switch to Opus 4 for architecture/strategy
   - You already have 5x credits

2. **Cost efficiency**:
   - $100/month saved = $1,200/year
   - Put that toward superconfig.dev hosting
   - Or conference travel for talks

3. **When to upgrade**:
   - When you're revenue positive
   - Or coding velocity is clearly bottlenecked
   - Not before product-market fit

**Pro tip**: Write clear CLAUDE.md instructions to keep Sonnet 4 focused. Example:
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md for SuperConfig

## Code Standards
- NEVER take shortcuts
- ALWAYS follow Rust best practices
- MUST have tests for new features
- If stuck, explain the problem fully

## Project Context
- Building universal config management
- WASM bindings are critical path
- Security and performance are non-negotiable
```

## 🚀 This Week's Checklist

**Monday-Tuesday**:
- [ ] Publish to crates.io (even if 0.1.0)
- [ ] Create website directory structure
- [ ] Start Dioxus website setup

**Wednesday-Thursday**:
- [ ] Basic website with hero + features
- [ ] Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
- [ ] Point superconfig.dev domain

**Friday-Weekend**:
- [ ] Begin Node.js WASM bindings
- [ ] Write launch blog post draft
- [ ] Prepare Show HN submission

## 💡 Critical Success Factor

**Momentum is everything**. Ship something visible every week:
- Week 1: Website live
- Week 2: Node.js "Hello World"
- Week 3: Launch posts
- Week 4: Encryption demo

This maintains excitement and attracts early adopters.

**Remember**: Perfect is the enemy of good. Ship v0.1.0 and iterate in public. The Rust community especially values transparency and progressive enhancement.
