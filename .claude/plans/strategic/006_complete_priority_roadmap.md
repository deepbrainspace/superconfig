# SuperConfig Complete Priority Roadmap

**Created**: July 27, 2025  
**Author**: Claude Opus 4  
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for all priorities and timelines

## ✅ COMPLETED ACTIONS

### Day 0 Success!
1. **Published to crates.io** ✅
2. **Domain acquired** ✅ 
3. **Next Priority**: Website + CLI tool

## 🎯 NEW STRATEGIC DECISION: Language Bindings First

**Updated Strategy (July 27, 2025)**:
- **FFI over WASM**: Native performance (99% vs 90%)
- **Direct napi-rs first**: Ship fast, build uniffi later if needed
- **Node.js priority**: Biggest ecosystem, most developers
- **CLI pushed to Week 4**: Bindings drive adoption more than CLI
- **Next.js website**: Simple, beautiful, easy to maintain

- **Figment backlash**: Always respectful positioning

### Personal Risks
- **Burnout**: Sustainable pace, take weekends
- **Scope creep**: Say no to non-core features
- **Perfectionism**: Ship at 80% quality
