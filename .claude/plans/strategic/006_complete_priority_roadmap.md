# SuperConfig Complete Priority Roadmap

**Created**: July 27, 2025  
**Author**: Claude Opus 4  
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for all priorities and timelines

## ✅ COMPLETED ACTIONS

### Day 0 Success!
1. **Published to crates.io** ✅
2. **Domain acquired** ✅ 
3. **Next Priority**: Website + CLI tool

## 🎯 NEW STRATEGIC DECISION: CLI First

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **WASM complexity**: Start with Node.js (easiest)

- **Figment backlash**: Always respectful positioning

### Personal Risks
- **Burnout**: Sustainable pace, take weekends
- **Scope creep**: Say no to non-core features
- **Perfectionism**: Ship at 80% quality
